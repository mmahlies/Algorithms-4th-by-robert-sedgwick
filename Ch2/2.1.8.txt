Suppose that we use insertion sort on a randomly ordered array where elements
have only one of three values. Is the running time linear, quadratic, or something in
between?

Since it is randomly sorted, I think that would mean that the insertion sort would have to perform many more times the number of operations that the number
 of values. If that's the case, then its not linear.So, it would likely be quadratic, or perhaps a little below quadratic.
 so I think it is below quadratic
