The Idea behind inserion sort is it behave much faster in partly ordered array so h-sort found to give it this advantage
Insertion sort is faster than selection sort for h-sorting because as "h" decreases, the array becomes partially sorted.
Insertion sort makes less comparisons in partially sorted arrays than selection sort.
